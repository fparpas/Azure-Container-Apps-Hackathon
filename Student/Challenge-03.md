# Challenge 03 - Application Lifecycle Management - Updates and Rollbacks

 [< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-04.md)

## Introduction
Applications evolve over time. In this challenge, you will learn how to update a Container App and manage its revisions. You will experience deploying a new version of your app while retaining the ability to roll back if necessary.

Change management in Azure Container Apps is powered by revisions, which are snapshots of each version of your container app.

A revision is an immutable snapshot of a container app. The first revision is automatically created when you deploy your container app. New revisions are automatically created when a container appâ€™s template configuration changes. 

Changes to a container app fall under two categories: revision-scope or application-scope changes. Revision-scope changes trigger a new revision when you deploy your app, while application-scope changes do not.

Azure Container Apps (ACA) supports two revision modes: single-revision mode, where only one revision is active at a time, and multi-revision mode, where multiple revisions can be active simultaneously for A/B testing or blue-green deployments. This flexibility helps manage updates effectively and minimizes downtime.

## Description
- Deploy a new revision of your Container App with an updated image: `mavilleg/acarevision-helloworld:acarevision-hellowold`.
- Configure 80/20 traffic splitting to test the new revision alongside the old version.
- Use the [revision label](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/revisions#labels) URL to access the updated revision.
- Test the update and then perform a rollback to the previous stable revision.

## Success Criteria
- A new revision is successfully deployed.
- Rollback to an earlier revision functions as expected.
- Use the revision label URL to access the new revision.
- By using the Azure CLI, get all the revisions available in a table format.
- Clearly explain to your coach:
  - The differences between revision-scope changes and application-scope changes.
  - The concepts of single-revision mode versus multi-revision mode, including scenarios and benefits of each.

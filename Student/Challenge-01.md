# Challenge 01 - Introduction to Azure Container Apps

 [< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Azure Container Apps hackathon! In this challenge, you will get an overview of Azure Container Apps. A managed, serverless container orchestration service that abstracts away infrastructure concerns.

Learn how container apps support microservices architectures, how they leverage Kubernetes under the hood, and how they provide features like scaling, ingress, and revision management without the overhead of managing clusters.

## Description
- Research and review the key concepts behind Azure Container Apps.
- Understand the difference between traditional Kubernetes and a serverless container platform.
- Explore the architecture: how container apps run in a managed environment, benefit from integrated autoscaling, and link with event-driven platforms.

## Success Criteria
- Explain what Azure Container Apps are and [how they compare](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/compare-options) to other container hosting options. Compare ACA to AKS, App Service and Azure Functions.
- Explain the key features of:
    - [Plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/plans)
    - [Environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/environment)
    - [Containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/containers)
    - [Revisions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/revisions)
    - [Application lifecycle management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/application-lifecycle-management)
    - [Scaling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/scale-app)
    - [Ingress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/ingress-overview)
- Explain and [compare container apps and jobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/jobs?tabs=azure-cli#compare-container-apps-and-jobs).
